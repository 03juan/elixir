.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTIONS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The program starts the runtime system typically for the execution of one or more scripts. It is similar to
.Xr iex 1 ,
but
.Nm
exits when the executed script does.
.Sh OPTIONS
Note that many of the options mentioned here were borrowed from the Erlang shell, therefore
.Xr erl 1
can be used as an additional source of information on the options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
{COMMON}
.It Fl -no-halt
Does not halt the Erlang VM after execution.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa ~/.erlang.cookie
Stores the value of the magic cookie which is used only when it wasn't specified via the option
.Fl -cookie
.Pq see above .
If the file doesn't exist when a node starts, it will be created.
.It Pa .iex.exs
After
.Nm
starts, it seeks the file
.Pa .iex.exs
and, in a case of success, executes the code from the file in the context of the shell. At first the search starts in the current working directory, then, if necessary, it continues in the home direcory.

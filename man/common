.It Fl e Ar expression
Evaluates
.Ar expression .
.It Fl r Ar file
Requires
.Ar file .
In other words, the specified file is checked for existence at the start of
.Nm .
.It Fl S Ar script
Executes
.Ar script .
.It Fl pa Ar directory
Adds
.Ar directory
to the beginning of the code path. If the specified directory already exists, it will be removed from its old position and put to the beginning.
.Pp
See also the function
.Sy :code.add_patha/1 .
.It Fl pr Ar file
Does the same thing as
.Fl r
.Pq see above
but in parallel.
.It Fl pz Ar directory
Adds
.Ar directory
to the end of the code path. If the specified directory already exists, it won't be neither removed from its old position nor put to the end.
.Pp
See also the function
.Sy :code.add_pathz/1 .
.It Fl -app Ar application
Starts
.Ar application
and all its dependencies.
.It Fl -cookie Ar value
Sets the magic cookie to
.Ar value .
If the value of the magic cookie isn't specified via the option
.Fl -cookie
when the node starts, it will be taken from the file
.Pa ~/.erlang.cookie
.Pq see the section Sy FILES .
Distributed nodes can interact with each other only when their magic cookies are equal.
.Pp
See also the function
.Sy :erlang.set_cookie/2 .
.It Fl -detached
Runs the Erlang runtime system detached from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl -hidden
Starts a hidden node.
.Pp
Connections between nodes are transitive. For example, if a node A is connected to a node B and the node B is connected to a node C, then the node A is connected to the node C. The option
.Fl -hidden
allows creating the node which can be connected to a specific node escaping redundant connections.
.Pp
The function
.Sy :erlang.nodes/0
allows getting the list of nodes connected to the target node, however the list won't include hidden nodes. Depending on the input parameter, the function
.Sy :erlang.nodes/1
allows getting the list which contains only hidden nodes
.Pq the parameter Ar :hidden
or both hidden and not hidden nodes
.Pq the parameter Ar :connected .
.It Fl -sname Ar name
Gives a node a short name and starts it. Short names take the form of
.Ar name Ns
@host, where host is the name of the target host
.Pq Xr hostname 1
which runs the node. The nodes with short names can interact with each other only in the same local network.
.It Fl -name Ar name
Gives a node a long name and starts it. Long names take the form of
.Ar name Ns
@host, where host is the IP address of the host which runs the node. In contrast to the nodes with short names, the nodes with long names aren't limited by boundaries of a local network
.Pq see above .
